# Baseline measurements

## Setup

We've run the algorithm 10,000 times for each board and each algorithm. Whenever a board was solved, we tracked how many moves it took for the algorithm to find a solution. The number of moves necessary was then stored so that we could perform some basic statistical calculations on them and plot both a distribution graph and a graph of the sorted list of number of moves, showing the difference in the number of moves over 10,000 runs.

## Algorithm 1: Uniform randomization of all available valid moves

### Performance

- #### Test Boards
    - Board 1 (6x6) - 13 vehicles: **xxx moves** (average over 10_000 runs)
    - Board 2 (6x6) - 13 vehicles:
    - Board 3 (6x6) - 9 vehicles:
    - Board 4 (6x6) - 22 vehicles:
    - Board 5 (9x9) - 24 vehicles:
    - Board 6 (9x9) - 26 vehicles:
    - Board 7 (12x12) - 44 vehicles:
